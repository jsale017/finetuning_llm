      "general": "The Balance Sheet Topic includes two Subtopics: Overall and Offsetting. The Overall Subtopic provides general guidance on classification of current assets and liabilities and working capital determination, while the Offsetting Subtopic provides criteria for offsetting amounts related to certain contracts and repurchase agreements. The balance sheet, also called statement of financial position, presents assets and liabilities classified logically to permit determination of working capital. Offsetting of assets and liabilities is generally improper except where a right of setoff exists, which involves only two parties and limited exceptions.",
      "scope": "The guidance in the Overall Subtopic applies when preparing a classified balance sheet for financial accounting and reporting purposes and applies to all entities. The Offsetting Subtopic guidance applies to all entities but does not apply to derecognition or nonrecognition of assets and liabilities. Exceptions to the right of setoff principle are limited to specific practices permitted by certain Subtopics.",

      "term": "Cash Equivalents",
      "definition": "Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that have both of the following characteristics: 1. Readily convertible to known amounts of cash 2. So near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example, both a three-month U.S. Treasury bill and a three-year U.S. Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However, a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months. Examples of items commonly considered to be cash equivalents are Treasury bills, commercial paper, money market funds, and federal funds sold (for an entity with banking operations)."

All charges and credits to those accounts are cash receipts or payments to both the entity owning the account and the bank holding it. For example, a bank's granting of a loan by crediting the proceeds to a customer's demand deposit account is a cash payment by the bank and a cash receipt of the customer when the entry is made."
