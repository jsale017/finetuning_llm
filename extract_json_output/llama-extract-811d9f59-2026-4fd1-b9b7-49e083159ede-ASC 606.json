An entity shall apply the guidance in this Topic to all contracts with customers, except for certain contracts such as lease contracts within the scope of Topic 842, insurance contracts within the scope of Topic 944, certain financial instruments, guarantees (other than product or service warranties), and nonmonetary exchanges between entities in the same line of business to facilitate sales to customers or potential customers.",
