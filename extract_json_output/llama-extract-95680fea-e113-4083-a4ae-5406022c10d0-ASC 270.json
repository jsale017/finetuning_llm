      "general": "The Interim Reporting Topic clarifies the application of accounting principles and reporting practices to interim financial information, including interim financial statements and summarized interim financial data of publicly traded companies issued for external reporting purposes. Interim financial information may include current data during a fiscal year on financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, and cash flows. This information may be issued on a monthly or quarterly basis or at other intervals and may take the form of either complete financial statements or summarized financial data. Interim financial information often is provided for each interim period or on a cumulative year-to-date basis, or both, and for the corresponding periods of the preceding year. The determination of the results of operations on a meaningful basis for intervals of less than a full year presents inherent difficulties, such as seasonal fluctuations in revenues and heavy fixed costs.",
