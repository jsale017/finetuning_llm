      "general": "The Presentation of Financial Statements Topic includes guidance on the presentation and disclosure of financial statements, including specific Subtopics on Overall presentation, Discontinued Operations, and Liquidation Basis of Accounting. The Overview and Background Sections provide material useful to understand typical situations addressed by the standards but do not summarize accounting and reporting requirements. The Discontinued Operations Subtopic provides guidance on presentation and disclosure requirements for discontinued operations, which may include components of an entity, groups of components, or business/nonprofit activities. The Liquidation Basis of Accounting Subtopic provides guidance on when and how to prepare financial statements using the liquidation basis and related disclosures.",
      "scope": "The Scope and Scope Exceptions Sections outline the entities, transactions, instruments, or events to which the guidance applies or does not apply. The Presentation of Financial Statements guidance applies to business entities and not-for-profit entities. The Discontinued Operations Subtopic applies to components or groups of components disposed of or classified as held for sale, and to business or nonprofit activities classified as held for sale on acquisition, with exceptions such as oil and gas properties accounted for under SEC full-cost method. The Liquidation Basis of Accounting Subtopic applies to all entities except investment companies regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940.",
