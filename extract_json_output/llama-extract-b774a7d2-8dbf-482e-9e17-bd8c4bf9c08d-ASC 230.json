      "term": "Board-Designated Endowment Fund",
      "definition": "An endowment fund created by a not-for-profit entity's (NFP's) governing board by designating a portion of its funds functioning as endowment or quasi-endowment funds). In rare circumstances, a board-designated endowment fund also can include a portion of net assets with donor restrictions. For example, if an NFP is unable to spend donor-restricted contributions in the near term, then the board sometimes considers the long-term investment of these funds. See Endowment Fund."
    },
    {
      "term": "Cash",
      "definition": "Consistent with common usage, cash includes not only currency on hand but demand deposits with banks or other financial institutions. Cash also includes other kinds of accounts that have the general characteristics of demand deposits in that the customer may deposit additional funds at any time and also effectively may withdraw funds at any time without prior notice or penalty. All charges and credits to those accounts are cash receipts or payments to both the entity owning the account and the bank holding it. For example, a bank's granting of a loan by crediting the proceeds to a customer's demand deposit account is a cash payment by the bank and a cash receipt of the customer when the entry is made."
    },
    {
      "term": "Cash Equivalents",
      "definition": "Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that have both of the following characteristics: a. Readily convertible to known amounts of cash b. So near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example, both a three-month U.S. Treasury bill and a three-year U.S. Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However, a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months. Examples of items commonly considered to be cash equivalents are Treasury bills, commercial paper, money market funds, and federal funds sold (for an entity with banking operations)."

    {
      "term": "Conditional Contribution",
      "definition": "A contribution that contains a donor-imposed condition."

      "term": "Contract",
      "definition": "An agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations."
    },
    {
      "term": "Contribution",
      "definition": "An unconditional transfer of cash or other assets, as well as unconditional promises to give, to an entity or a reduction, settlement, or cancellation of its liabilities in a voluntary nonreciprocal transfer by another entity acting other than as an owner. Those characteristics distinguish contributions from: a. Exchange transactions, which are reciprocal transfers in which each party receives and sacrifices approximately commensurate value b. Investments by owners and distributions to owners, which are nonreciprocal transfers between an entity and its owners c. Other nonreciprocal transfers, such as impositions of taxes or legal judgments, fines, and thefts, which are not voluntary transfers. In a contribution transaction, the resource provider often receives value indirectly by providing a societal benefit although that benefit is not considered to be of commensurate value. In an exchange transaction, the potential public benefits are secondary to the potential direct benefits to the resource provider. The term contribution revenue is used to apply to transactions that are part of the entity's ongoing major or central activities (revenues), or are peripheral or incidental to the entity (gains). See also Conditional Contribution."
    },
    {
      "term": "Donor-Imposed Condition",
      "definition": "A donor stipulation (donors include other types of contributors, including makers of certain grants) that represents a barrier that must be overcome before the recipient is entitled to the assets transferred or promised. Failure to overcome the barrier gives the contributor a right of return of the assets it has transferred or gives the promisor a right of release from its obligation to transfer its assets."
    },
    {
      "term": "Donor-Imposed Restriction",
      "definition": "A donor stipulation (donors include other types of contributors, including makers of certain grants) that specifies a use for a contributed asset that is more specific than broad limits resulting from the following: a. The nature of the not-for-profit entity (NFP) b. The environment in which it operates c. The purposes specified in its articles of incorporation or bylaws or comparable documents for an unincorporated association. Some donors impose restrictions that are temporary in nature, for example, stipulating that resources be used after a specified date, for particular programs or services, or to acquire buildings or equipment. Other donors impose restrictions that are perpetual in nature, for example, stipulating that resources be maintained in perpetuity. Laws may extend those limits to investment returns from those resources and to other enhancements (diminishments) of those resources. Thus, those laws extend donor-imposed restrictions."
    },
    {
      "term": "Donor-Restricted Endowment Fund",
      "definition": "An endowment fund that is created by a donor stipulation (donors include other types of contributors, including makers of certain grants) requiring investment of the gift in perpetuity or for a specified term. Some donors or laws may require that a portion of income, gains, or both be added to the gift and invested subject to similar restrictions. The term does not include a Board-Designated Endowment Fund. See Endowment Fund."
    },
    {
      "term": "Effective Interest Rate",
      "definition": "The rate of return implicit in the financial asset, that is, the contractual interest rate adjusted for any net deferred fees or costs, premium, or discount existing at the origination or acquisition of the financial asset. For purchased financial assets with credit deterioration, however, to decouple interest income from credit loss recognition, the premium or discount at acquisition excludes the discount embedded in the purchase price that is attributable to the acquirer's assessment of credit losses at the date of acquisition."
    },
    {
      "term": "Endowment Fund",
      "definition": "An established fund of cash, securities, or other assets to provide income for the maintenance of a not-for-profit entity (NFP). The use of the assets of the fund may be with or without donor-imposed restrictions. Endowment funds generally are established by donor-restricted gifts and bequests to provide a source of income in perpetuity or for a specified period. See Donor-Restricted Endowment Fund. Alternatively, an NFP's governing board may earmark a portion of its Funds Functioning as Endowment."

      "term": "Financing Activities",
      "definition": "Financing activities include obtaining resources from owners and providing them with a return on, and a return of, their investment; receiving restricted resources that by donor stipulation must be used for long-term purposes; borrowing money and repaying amounts borrowed, or otherwise settling the obligation; and obtaining and paying for other resources obtained from creditors on long-term credit."
    },
    {
      "term": "Funds Functioning as Endowment",
      "definition": "Net assets without donor restrictions (donors include other types of contributors, including makers of certain grants) designated by an entity's governing board to be invested to provide income for generally a long but not necessarily specified period. A board-designated endowment, which results from an internal designation, is generally not donor-restricted and is classified as net assets without donor restrictions. The governing board has the right to decide at any time to expend such funds. In rare circumstances, funds functioning as endowment also can include a portion of board-designated endowment funds."
    },
    {
      "term": "Inherent Contribution",
      "definition": "A contribution that results if an entity voluntarily transfers assets (or net assets) or performs services for another entity in exchange for either no assets or for assets of substantially lower value and unstated rights or privileges of a commensurate value are not involved."

It is required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to file or furnish financial statements, or does file or furnish financial statements (including voluntary filers), with the SEC (including other entities whose financial statements or financial information are required to be or are included in a filing). 2. It is required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Act), as amended, or rules or regulations promulgated under the Act, to file or furnish financial statements with a regulatory agency other than the SEC. 3. It is required to file or furnish financial statements with a foreign or domestic regulatory agency in preparation for the sale of or for purposes of issuing securities that are not subject to contractual restrictions on transfer. 4. It has issued, or is a conduit bond obligor for, securities that are traded, listed, or quoted on an exchange or an over-the-counter market. 5. It has one or more securities that are not subject to contractual restrictions on transfer, and it is required by law, contract, or regulation to prepare U.S. GAAP financial statements (including notes) and make them publicly available on a periodic basis (for example, interim or annual periods). An entity must meet both of these conditions to meet this criterion. An entity may meet the definition of a public business entity solely because its financial statements or financial information is included in another entity's filing with the SEC. In that case, the entity is only a public business entity for purposes of financial statements that are filed or furnished with the SEC."
